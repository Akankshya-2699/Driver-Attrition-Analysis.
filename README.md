## Project Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and formatting the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data through visualizations and statistics.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Enhancing the data with new features for better model performance.
4. **Model Building**: Training machine learning models to predict driver attrition.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using various metrics.

## Requirements

The analysis was performed in Google Colab, so no installation is required. However, if you'd like to run the code locally, you can install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
